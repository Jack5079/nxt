## How to install?

this requires ffmpeg btw lol

Rename `.env.example` to `.env`

After that, replace the text after `TOKEN=` with your bot's token, and replace the text after `OWNER=` with your Discord ID.
You can also add `SUPPORT=` if you have a support server. You don't need to, however.

Finally, open the terminal and type these commands:

```bash
npm i
npm run build
```
