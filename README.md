- Commands basically are an object
  - The `help` property shows up in the help command
  - `aliases` is optional and is a `string[]` of names that will be used as aliases for your command
  - And of course: the `run` property
    - run is a function with the `this` value set to the bot (typings at utils/types)
    - if it returns a truthy value then it will try to post it
    - it has two arguments
      - argument 1 is the Discord.js message
      - argument 2 is the arguments (`string[]`)
- If you are using Visual Studio Code you should be able to create a command in a new TypeScript file by typing in "command" and pressing Tab.
- The command handler is in `trollsmile-core`: <https://github.com/troiismile/core>
- The command loader is in `events/ready.ts`
