-sayvc → -ttsvc

## How to install?

1. Install dependencies:

```bash
sudo apt install ffmpeg
npm i
```

2. Rename `.env.example` to `.env`

3. Replace the text after `TOKEN=` with your bot's token, and replace the text after `OWNER=` with your Discord ID.
   You can also add `SUPPORT=` if you have a support server. You don't need to, however.

4. Compile the bot by running `npm run build` in your terminal.
