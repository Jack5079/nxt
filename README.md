# NXTBOT

_THIS IS NXT_

A terrible Discord bot.

## Migrating from everythingbot/jackbot?

-say → -tts

-stats → -about

-saybot → -say

-sayvc → -ttsvc

## How to install?

### Normal

1. Install dependencies:

```bash
sudo apt install ffmpeg
npm i
```

2. Rename `.env.example` to `.env`

3. Replace the text after `TOKEN=` with your bot's token, and replace the text after `OWNER=` with your Discord ID.
   You can also add `SUPPORT=` if you have a support server. You don't need to, however.

4. Compile the bot by running `npm run build` in your terminal.
