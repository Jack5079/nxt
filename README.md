A terrible Discord bot.

> note: nxt has recently moved from @Jack5079 to @NXTB0T

## How to install?

1. Install dependencies:

```bash
sudo apt install ffmpeg # Soon this won't be the case
npm i
```

2. Rename `example.env` to `.env`

3. Open `.env` and:
   1. Replace the text after `TOKEN=` with your bot's token
   2. Replace the text after `OWNER=` with your Discord ID.
   3. You can also add `SUPPORT=` if you have a support server. You don't need to, however.

4. Compile the bot by running `npm run build` in your terminal.
