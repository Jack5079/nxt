# jackbot-next

The flagship JackBot. The reason [`jackbot-discord`](https://npm.im/jackbot-discord) exists.

## How to run

Create a .env file with the following contents:

```
TOKEN=BOT_TOKEN_GOES_HERE
OWNER=OWNER_ID_GOES_HERE
```

Obviously, replace `BOT_TOKEN_GOES_HERE` with the bot token and `OWNER_ID_GOES_HERE` with your Discord ID

After doing that, open the terminal and type these commands:

```bash
npm i
npm run-script build
npm start
```
